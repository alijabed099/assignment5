5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example?


Ans : A  favicon  short for  favorite icon  is a small image or icon associated with a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes in search results or social media posts when a website is shared. Favicons serve as a visual representation or branding element for a website, making it easily recognizable to users.


Here's how you would include this favicon in the HTML code of your website: 


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Example For Favicon</title>
    <!-- Add the favicon link -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- <h1> content goes here</h1> -->
</body>
</html>


In this example, the <link> element with the rel attribute set to "icon" and the href attribute pointing to your favicon file "favicon.ico" tells the browser to use this icon as the website's favicon. When users visit your website, they will see this favicon in their browser's tabs, bookmarks, and other relevant places, helping them easily identify and remember your site.
